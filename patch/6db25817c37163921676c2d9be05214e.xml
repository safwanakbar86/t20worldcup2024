		A description of what this file contains.  This file contains a list of bowler ID's who are extra fast bowlers.
		With these bowlers are two numbers.  
		
		The MaxFake is the fastest that they can bowl in miles per hour. This does not affect actual speed
		in game, just what displays in the overlays.  (this is translated to kilometers per hour if used).
		
		The MaxReal is the fastest that they can bowl in meters per second.  This affects the actual in game delivery, but not what
		shows up in the overlays.
